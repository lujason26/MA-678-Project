# MA-678-Project

champion_stats contains the stats for each champion

final_data is the final cleaned dataset containing side, team, league, champions, result (1 is won, 0 is lost), and average stats for team

matches2020 is the original dataset of LoL professional Esport matches in 2020

wr_all_by_region contains win rate of each champion by region

wr_overall contains win rate of each champion not by region

Project Rscript has all the running, plots, and cleaning; have yet to incorporate a function that takes in the champion and converts to stats but it shouldn't be that time consuming later on when I choose to do it

Project Report RMD creates the pdf

Project Report PDF is the submission; the format is slightly weird from the plots that I do not know how to adjust
